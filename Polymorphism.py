## The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function
#  name (but different signatures) being used for different types.

# Python program to demonstrate in-built poly-
# morphic functions
 
# len() being used for a string
print(len("geeks"))
 
# len() being used for a list
print(len([10, 20, 30]))


# A simple Python function to demonstrate
# Polymorphism
 
def add(x, y, z = 0):    ### Default Value of Z is Zero if we dont provide any value
    return x + y + z
 
# Driver code
print(add(2, 3))
print(add(2, 3, 4))

## Polymorphism with class methods: 

## The below code shows how Python can use two different class types, in the same way. We create a for
#  loop that iterates through a tuple of objects. Then call the methods without being concerned about 
#  which class type each object is. We assume that these methods actually exist in each class. 


class India():
    def capital(self):
        print("New Delhi is the capital of India.")
 
    def language(self):
        print("Hindi is the most widely spoken language of India.")
 
    def type(self):
        print("India is a developing country.")
 
class USA():
    def capital(self):
        print("Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.")
 
    def language(self):
        print("English is the primary language of USA.")
 
    def type(self):
        print("USA is a developed country.")
 
obj_ind = India()
obj_usa = USA()
for country in (obj_ind, obj_usa):
    country.capital()
    country.language()
    country.type()
## Output: 
## New Delhi is the capital of India.
## Hindi is the most widely spoken language of India.
## India is a developing country.
## Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.
## English is the primary language of USA.
## USA is a developed country.



## Polymorphism with Inheritance: 

## In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods
#  in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. However,
#  it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is 
# particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesnâ€™t quite fit the child 
# class. In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. This process of re-implementing a method 
# in the child class is known as Method Overriding. 

class Bird:
  def intro(self):
    print("There are many types of birds.")
     
  def flight(self):
    print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")
   
class sparrow(Bird):
  def flight(self):
    print("Sparrows can fly.")
     
class ostrich(Bird):
  def flight(self):
    print("Ostriches cannot fly.")
     
obj_bird = Bird()
obj_spr = sparrow()
obj_ost = ostrich()
 
obj_bird.intro()
obj_bird.flight()
 
obj_spr.intro()
obj_spr.flight()
 
obj_ost.intro()
obj_ost.flight()

## There are many types of birds.
## Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.
## There are many types of birds.
## Sparrows can fly.
## There are many types of birds.
## Ostriches cannot fly.
